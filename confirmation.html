        <h2>Quick Takeaways – Episode 1: A Smarter Supplement Strategy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Supplements aren’t always needed — many healthy people don’t benefit.</li>
            <li>They become essential when stress, medication, ageing factors, or injury increase nutrient demand or reduce absorption.</li>
            <li>The correct dose depends on your health, genes, and medications — not a one-size-fits-all.</li>
            <li>Form matters: magnesium bisglycinate, citrate, or malate are better absorbed.</li>
            <li>Choose quality: clear labels, trusted brands, no hype or multi-herb blends.</li>
            <li>If it makes bold promises or sounds too good to be true — it probably is.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Full Recap – Episode 1: A Smarter Supplement Strategy</h2>

        <!-- Inserted recap here (from earlier response) -->

        <p>Thank you again for joining us for the Smarter Health Conversations 6-part series.
        Instead of sending out a 50-minute video recording, which was not as structured as I would have liked it to be, I thought a clear, to-the-point summary—including a few things I didn’t get time to cover—would be more useful.</p>

        <p>Valuable questions were asked in the session and in the registration questionnaire; these guide each Q&A so you get the information you need to know.</p>

        <h3>The Q&A</h3>
        <!-- ... full Q&A continues (as already pasted in your live page) ... -->
        <p>We look forward to seeing you live for Episode 2!</p>
